## ASU Insurance

This article details the logistics of ASU’s student health insurance plan. More information about billing, or for if you have a different insurance plan, can be found [here](https://eoss.asu.edu/health/billing-insurance).

### Using the ASU My Health Portal 
The ASU My Health Portal is your one-stop shop for all of ASU’s services. Under the ASU plan, it is often cheaper and simpler to use ASU health services than to use other in-network providers. ASU offers the following services: lab testing, medication, primary care, same-day appointments for urgent care, tobacco cessation, travel medicine, vaccines, STI testing, wellness, women’s health, X-rays, sports medicine, and LGBTQIA services. More information about the services can be found on the EOSS page (see **Resources**). 

Besides scheduling appointments, you can also upload proof of immunizations, download your insurance card (if using ASU student insurance), access COVID-19 testing results, and communicate with ASU healthcare providers in the My Health Portal.

### What’s covered under ASU’s student insurance?
The detailed summary of benefits (see **Resources**) is the full list of everything that’s covered by the ASU student insurance plan. The quick summary of benefits (see **Resources**) has a more condensed version of the detailed summary.

### How can I find in-network healthcare providers?
The Aetna portal (see **Resources**) has a search function where you can find in-network providers for a variety of services. After logging in, select “Find Care” from the options at the top. In the drop-down menu that appears, select “Open Choice PPO”, then “Update My View”. From here, you can see your provider and visit history, or choose to search for new providers based on the following categories:
- Medical Doctors & Specialists: Primary care physicians, pediatricians, cardiologists, OB/GYNs, and others
- Hospitals & Facilities: Hospitals, urgent care centers, walk-in clinics, physical therapy centers, and others
- Talk to a Doctor: This telehealth option is available 24/7
- Behavioral Health: Counseling, EAP, mental health facilities, substance abuse treatment, psychiatrists, and others 
- Alternative Medicine: Chiropractors, acupuncturists, massage therapists, dieticians, and others
- Vision: Routine eye exams, glasses, and contact lenses
- Labs & Testing: Bloodwork, lab tests, diagnostic testing centers, sleep centers, imaging centers, and others
- Pharmacy: Search for pharmacies by name or location
- Durable Medical Equipment (DME): Hearing aids, breast pumps, prosthetics, wheelchairs, diabetes equipment, and others
- Common Procedures & Conditions: Search providers by procedures they perform or conditions they treat.
Each of these categories has its own set of options and filters. However, bear in mind that the options presented here are **not necessarily covered by the ASU plan**. Refer to the detailed summary of benefits (see **Resources**) to check if the service you need is covered by the plan.

### Dental and vision: what’s covered
Dental care is not covered by the ASU student insurance plan. You will need to purchase dental care out of pocket, or buy dental insurance separately from the ASU plan. 

Vision care is covered by the plan. The student health insurance plan covers 1 yearly eye exam at the $25 copay with no referral required. There is no coverage on frames, lenses, or contact that would be an out of pocket purchase. However, you can receive a discount when using EyeMed providers which can be located following the steps in the previous section.
